## Step 1

Prompt text: rewrite to become a react app that looks like a simplistic iphone frame and resolution, and inside add a line of text that says "Hello, World!"

## Step 2

Prompt text: let's now make multiple pages, each with basic text denoting the names of them: In a new folder titled "Pages" under "frontend/src", make new files for a Calendar page, ToDo list page, and a Profile page. The index.js file will serve as our Home page. To denote each page, include basic text in each file with the corresponding name of the file. For each page, include 3 funtional navigation buttons to get to the other pages.

### Step 2a

The navigation didn't work, nor did it function how I expected it to, because it used a different nav tool than I am used to. I now will `npm install react-router-dom` and instruct Cursor to use that instead. I also made some stylistic changes:
- `ToDo List` -> `ToDo`
- Removed basic description text for each page

## Step 3

Prompt text: Change the buttons to a selectable nav bar at the bottom. Should have all 4 tabs with the selected tab greyed out.

## Step 3a

- Changed colors to start reflecting the identity of the project
- Removed rectangular visual for the buttons
- Fixed misc alignment issues
