## Step 1

Prompt text: rewrite to become a react app that looks like a simplistic iphone frame and resolution, and inside add a line of text that says "Hello, World!"

## Step 2

Prompt text: let's now make multiple pages, each with basic text denoting the names of them: In a new folder titled "Pages" under "frontend/src", make new files for a Calendar page, ToDo list page, and a Profile page. The index.js file will serve as our Home page. To denote each page, include basic text in each file with the corresponding name of the file. For each page, include 3 funtional navigation buttons to get to the other pages.

### Step 2a

The navigation didn't work, nor was it what I wanted. I now will `npm install react-router-dom` and instruct Cursor to use that instead. I will also make some stylistic changes:
- `ToDo List` -> `ToDo`
- Removed basic description text for each page
